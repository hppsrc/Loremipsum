## Getting Started üéØ

### Dependencies / Requirements üóÉÔ∏è

#### Dependencies

- [CLRSTR.h](https://github.com/hppsrc/libs/blob/main/C/CLRSTR.h) (Build 25011820)

#### Requirements

- `clang >19`
  - via MSYS2 for Windows. (using CLANG64)

- `mingw-w64-gcc`
  - for Windows Building on Linux.

### Build yourself üõ†Ô∏è

- Using `make`:

        make build

> [!NOTE]
> The makefile doesn't allow you to create a Linux binary from Windows, only from Linux to Windows.

### Download ‚¨áÔ∏è

Download last binaries for:

- [Windows x64](https://github.com/hppsrc/Loremipsum/releases/download/0.2.2-alpha/linter_Windows_x86_64.exe)
- [Linux x64](https://github.com/hppsrc/Loremipsum/releases/download/0.2.2-alpha/linter_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz)

### Installing ‚öôÔ∏è

*No installation required.*

### Using Loremipsum üíª

- You must pass as argument a file of the type `.loremipsum`:

        linter.exe file.loremipsum

- You can also use some flags:

        linter.exe --o file.loremipsum

> [!WARNING]
> No flags have been implemented yet

The file format is as follows:

```JS
LOREMIPSUM LOREMIPSUM loremipsum loremipsum loremipsum loremipsum loremipsum loremipsum loremipsum loremipsum 
LOREMIPSUM LOREMIPSUM LOREMIPSUM loremipsum loremipsum loremipsum loremipsum loremipsum loremipsum loremipsum loremipsum loremipsum 
```

This code gives you as output `Hi`.

Uppercase `LOREMIPSUM` is 32.

Lowercase `loremipsum` is 1.

The file can have a maximum of 255 lines, any extra line will be ignored.

Each line is interpreted one by one and stored in the array, at the end of which the result or an error message is printed, also as to end with a space.

At each match, 1 or 32 is added to the position array based on the current line.
